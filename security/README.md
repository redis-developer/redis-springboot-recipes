# Redis Security Recipes
Redis Security Recipes provide practical examples of how to secure your Redis-powered Spring Boot applications. This section focuses on patterns and implementations that leverage Redisâ€™ security features, ensuring your applications are both robust and protected.

## Use Cases

This section currently includes the following recipe:

| Use Case  | Description                                                                                                                                          | Link                     |

| Multi-ACL | Demonstrates how to configure and manage multiple Redis ACL users in Spring Boot, separating read and write responsibilities across different users. | [multi-acl](./multi-acl) |                                                                                                                                                      |      |

Each submodule contains a complete Spring Boot application that demonstrates the respective security configuration.
